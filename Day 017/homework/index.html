        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that
         allows computers <br> and software to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence—such as:<br>
        AI mainly works through machine learning,<br> a process where algorithms learn rules and <br>relationships
             directly from data instead of following strict, pre-written instructions. <br>During training, id
              the system is fed millions of examples,<br>
             allowing it to recognize patterns and develop the ability to make predictions.

             <img src="What-is-AI-how-does-it-work.webp" width="600px" class="workai">
             <p>Most modern AI works through learning from data.<br>
                The main principle is:</p>

                <br><br>
            <ol class="list2">
                <li>The system is given a large amount of data.</li>
                <li>Algorithms learn patterns and relationships within that data.</li>
                 <li>After training, the AI can analyze and interpret new information.</li>
                <li>Neural networks imitate the structure of the human<br> brain—layers
                         of interconnected “neurons” process information.</li>
             </ol>
             <br><br>
            <p>in reality, AI does not think like a human.<br> It is based on statistical models and prediction.</p>

            <h1 id="influence">How Does AI Influence the Modern World?</h1>
            <p>AI has become deeply integrated into modern society.<br> In healthcare,
                 AI helps doctors detect diseases earlier and more accurately.<br>
                 In education, AI tools support students with personalized <br>explanations and study plans.
                 Businesses rely on AI to analyze customer behavior,<br>
                 optimize processes, and make better strategic decisions.<br></p>
            <img src="What-is-Artificial-Intelligence-.webp" alt="" width="600px" class="webp">
                 <p>In transportation, AI powers self-driving systems and improves traffic management<br> in large cities.
                     In the creative industries, AI assists artists,<br> designers, 
                     and musicians by generating new ideas and content.<br> Even in everyday life,
                     recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube,<br> TikTok, and Spotify 
                     use AI to tailor content to each users interests.</p>

            <h1>Ethical Challenges and Responsibilities</h1>
            <p>As AI becomes more powerful, it also raises important ethical questions. <br>One major concern is privacy
                 — AI systems often require access to sensitive data,<br> which must be handled responsibly.
                  Another challenge is algorithmic bias:<br> if the data used to train AI contains unfair patterns,<br>
                 the system may unintentionally produce discriminatory results</p>
                 <h2>Will AI Replace Humans? — My Opinion</h2>
                 <p>In my view, AI will not replace humans entirely, but it will<br> transform many types of work. 
                    Repetitive or predictable tasks may be automated,<br> reducing the need for manual labor in some sectors.<br>
                     However, AI cannot replace human qualities such as empathy, creativity,<br>
                     moral judgment, and emotional understanding.</p>
