       <p>There are three types of routines: a 'balance' routine, where the focus is on strength,<br> poise and flexibility; a 'dynamic' routine,
         which includes throws, somersaults and catches
        , and a 'combined' routine <br> which includes elements from both balance and dynamic.</p>
        <br>
    <P>Acrobatic gymnasts perform in one of five units: pairs (same-gender or mixed) or same-gender groups
             (three for women, four for men).<br> In each partnership, the gymnasts' different sizes
             and abilities will be balanced to complement each other in order to carry out the complex moves.<br> 
             Some will mainly carry out supporting and pitching roles and are known as bases.<br> They are then balanced with 
             usually smaller gymnasts who become the 'tops'. In men's and women's groups there are also one or two 'middles',<br>
              who are like another base who usually will support the top while balancing on the base.
              <br><br><br>
            In competition, partnerships perform a routine to music, which has usually been choreographed specifically for them.<br>
             The gymnasts carry out their acrobatic moves and combine them with dance, all in time to and in keeping with <br>
            the style of the music. Partnerships are judged on artistry/dance, execution of skills, and difficulty of skills,<br>
             with the scoring emphasis on execution.[3]

            The rules for the sport, known as the Code of Points, are governed by the FIG. These rules are subject to change'<br>
         every four years in line with the Olympic cycle, as in other disciplines of gymnastics.</P>
    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>In 1957, the first international competition was held between the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, and East Germany.[4]<br>
             The International Federation of Sports Acrobatics was established in 1973, and the first world championships were held in 1974.[4][6] 
             <br>The federation dissolved in 1998, and acrobatic gymnastics was from then on governed by the FIG.
             It was originally called sports acrobatics <br>but has been known as acrobatic gymnastics since 2007.[4]</p>
    <h2>Competitions</h2>
    <p>Acrobatic gymnastics is part of the World Games, and it is also included in the European Games as well as having a dedicated Acrobatic<br>
                Gymnastics World Championships held in even numbered years (known as World Sports Acrobatics Championships prior to 2006)<br>,
                 and continental or region championships in odd numbered years. For example, <br>
                the 28th Acrobatic Gymnastics European Championships were held in Rzeszow, Poland in October 2017.</p>
    <h2>Routines</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Balance</b>(formerly known as Static) – A balance routine requires that certain poses or 'balances'<br> 
            and must be held static for a specific duration. These moves require strength, poise, elegance and flexibility.<br>
             Gymnasts will combine into towers, or pyramids with the tops holding a particular position balanced on their bases. <br>
             Traditionally, balance routines were often performed to slower music, but not exclusively so.<br>
            Balance routines last approximately two minutes and forty seconds.</li>
            <li><b>dynamic</b>(formerly known as Tempo) – These routines demonstrate power,<br>
                 strength and grace through the performance of acrobatic moves that involve the phases of spring, flight, rotation, and landing.<br>
                 This often involves the base, or bases in the partnership propelling the top through the air and through a series of somersaults<br>
                  or twists. The top is generally caught or supported in the landing by their base(s).<br>
                 Dynamic routines last approximately two minutes.</li>
                 <li><b>Combined</b>At the more senior levels of competition (11–19 through senior levels), <br>
                    a third routine must be performed that combines both balance and dynamic moves, along with the usual tumbling and dance<br>
                     (tumbling is not required from senior level athletes). Typically, it is performed as a final's routine, with a duration,<br>
                     depending upon the level of competition, of approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds</li>
