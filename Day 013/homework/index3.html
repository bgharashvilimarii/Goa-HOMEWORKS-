    <p>The iPhone is a line of smartphones developed and marketed by Apple that run iOS,<br>
         the company's own mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then–Apple CEO and <br>
         co-founder Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at Macworld 2007<br>
          and launched later that year. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models <br>
        and iOS versions; the latest models being the iPhone 17, the higher-end iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max,<br>
         and the thinner iPhone Air. As of July 2025, more than 3 billion iPhones have been sold,<br>
          and Apple has been the largest vendor of mobile phones since 2023.
<br><br>
The original iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology.<br>
 Throughout its history, the iPhone has gained larger, higher-resolution displays, <br>
 video-recording functionality, waterproofing, and many accessibility features.<br>
  Up to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel,<br>
   with the iPhone 5s and later integrating a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since the iPhone X,[note 2]<br>
   iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition <br>
   in place of Touch ID for authentication, and increased use of gestures in place of the home button for navigation.<br>
<br><br>
The iPhone, which operates using Apple's proprietary iOS software,<br>
 is one of the two major smartphone platforms in the world, alongside Android.<br>
  The first-generation iPhone was described by Steve Jobs as a "revolution" for the mobile phone industry.<br>
   The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the slate smartphone form factor, and with creating a <br>
    large market for smartphone apps, or "app economy"; laying the foundation for the boom of the market for<br>
     mobile devices. In addition to the apps that come pre-installed on iOS, there are nearly 2 million apps available<br>
      for download from Apple's mobile distribution marketplace, the App Store, as of August 2024.</p>
